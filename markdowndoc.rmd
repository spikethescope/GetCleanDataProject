This is an R Markdown document for the project on Getting and Cleaning data.
This document describes how the data is sourced from the web and cleaned and then
processed to get a **tidy data**.
The source is the samsung data set containing sensor data. 

Step 1: Get the data
---
Get the data from the specified source:
<https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip>

The extracted data contains both training and test data in different folders.

Step 2: 
---
Read both test and train data, store data from each file. Rename the Variable names using colnames() function.

Step 3:
---
Create a single variable by merging subject, x, y values of train and test seperately.

Then combine both data into a single dataset.

Step 4:Prepare data to extract statistical info
---
Load library **dplyr**.
Create a logical index and use it select columns containing **mean,std,id**

Step 5: Clean the column names
---
The column names are not proper. Lets clean it up. 
First store column names in a seperate variable and then use **search and replace** command to convert names into readable ones.

Step 6: Modification and Summarise data:
---
First use dplyr commands to group data by **subject id**, **activity_names**
Then summarise the resultant data set. Now tidy data is ready.

Step 7: Output tidy data
---
The tidy data is then written into a text file **tidydata.txt**
